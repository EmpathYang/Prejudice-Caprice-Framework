LLMs are revolutionizing society fast! üöÄ Ever wondered if your LLM assistant could be biased? Could it affect your important decisions, job prospects, legal matters, healthcare, or even your kid‚Äôs future education? üò± Need a flexible framework to measure this risk?

Check out our new paper: the [Prejudice-Volatility Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15481) (PVF)! üìë Unlike previous methods, we measure LLMs‚Äô discrimination risk by considering both models‚Äô persistent bias and preference changes across contexts. Intuitively, different from rolling a biased die, LLMs‚Äô bias changes with its environment (conditioned prompts)!

Our findings? üßê We tested 12 common LLMs and found: i) prejudice risk is the primary cause of discrimination risk in LLMs, indicating that inherent biases in these models lead to stereotypical outputs; ii) most LLMs exhibit significant pro-male stereotypes across nearly all careers; iii) alignment with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback lowers discrimination by reducing prejudice, but increases volatility; iv) discrimination risk in LLMs correlates with socio-economic factors like profession salaries! üìä

## Replication
### Environment Setup

Create environment:

```bash
conda create -n pvf python=3.8.5
conda activate pvf
```

Install pytorch and python packages:

```bash
conda install -n pvf pytorch==1.7.1 torchvision==0.8.2 torchaudio==0.7.2 cudatoolkit=11.0 -c pytorch
cd Prejudice-Volatility-Framework
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
```

### Experiments

#### Toy Examples for Explaining how PVF Work

```

#### Collect Context Templates:

```bash
bash scripts/collect_context_templates.sh
```

#### Replicate Results in the Paper
